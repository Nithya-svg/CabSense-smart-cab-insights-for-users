## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nithya-svg/CabSense-smart-cab-insights-for-users.git
cd CabSense-smart-cab-insights-for-users
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

*(or)*

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Open browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Taxi dataset (`taxi.csv`) is loaded.
2. ML model is trained using historical data.
3. Trained model is saved as `model.pkl`.
4. Flask loads the model and serves predictions.
5. User interacts with the system via web UI.
6. Results are displayed instantly.
